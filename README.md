This project examines a collection of employee, manager, and department data to answer multiple questions about salaries, time of service, etc.

It uses PostgreSQL to import csvs with the applicable information into SQL and sort it using a variety of queries. There is an ERD showing the connections in the data, and a Jupyter notebook file showing a breakdown of salaries by range and by title.
